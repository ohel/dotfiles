Desktop launcher files. Should be in: `~/.local/share/applications`
Most are pretty custom and special, but some are generally useful.

The autostart directory has common application autostart launchers. They should be put in `~/.config/autostart` at least when using XFCE.

The pause directory has the source code for the simplest application possible: it just waits to be terminated. I use it in a minimal XFCE session.
