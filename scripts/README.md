Some picks from the scripts:

* backlight.sh: Change laptop screen backlight brightness via script.
* backup.sh: My full system backup script.
* browser.sh: Chromium browser helper script.
* copymusic.sh: I use this to copy music to my phone. I just drag'n'drop songs from my media player into a terminal window while the script is running. I store my music in lossless format, so this script calls the copymusic_encode.sh script in parallel to encode files on fly.
* copymusic_encode.sh: Encodes and tags a source audio file to destination file.
* kvm: Kernel-based Virtual Machine scripts.
* lcd: Matrix Orbital LK202 LCD display control scripts.
* network_all: An OpenRC script to set up a network interface and a bridge for virtual machines.
* updatesystem.sh: My Gentoo system update script.
* quodlibet: Various scripts to control Quod Libet music player.

Also contains various other scripts. Every script should have some comment about what it does.
