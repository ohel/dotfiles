Files to help one play the Alesis Turbo Mesh Kit (and other edrums) easily.
The setup is described in [a review I made](https://panther.kapsi.fi/posts/2022-12-23_alesis_turbo), also available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkVhLhOb144).

* `alesis_turbo.sh`: A shell script to setup everything for a drumming session with one easy command.
* `alesis_turbo.py`: A mididings script to fix the behaviour of the Alesis Turbo Mesh Kit hi-hat pedal.
* `hydrogen_drumkits`: Drumkit setups for the Hydrogen drum machine. These are located usually in `~/.hydrogen/data/drumkits/` along with the wave files for the actual sounds.
* `alesis_record_setup_jack_patchbay.xml`: A recording setup I used for the review. Not needed if just playing the drums. The shell script connects everything dynamically anyway.
* `drum_practice.h2song`: A Hydrogen song with a preloaded drumkit + sound to use as a metronome while playing.
